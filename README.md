‚öôÔ∏è Core Concepts & Features
Book Inventory: The library's collection is stored and managed using a Python list or a dictionary, offering efficient addition and removal of books.

Borrow/Return Functionality: Users can borrow or return books, which updates the book's availability status.

Undo/Redo Actions: A Python list is used to simulate a stack to store recent borrow/return actions. You can undo the last action, which reverts the book's status and updates the inventory.

Search & Filter: Easily find books by title or author. The search functionality is not case-sensitive.

Data Persistence: The book inventory is saved to and loaded from a file (e.g., books.json or books.txt), so your data is preserved between sessions.

üöÄ How to Run
Prerequisites: Ensure you have Python installed on your system.

Execution:

Save the Python code in a file (e.g., e_library.py).

Open your terminal or command prompt.

Follow the on-screen menu to interact with the library system.

üìã Sample Output
